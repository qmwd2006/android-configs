Generally, we are trying to catch up on all things required in kernel in VTS (So, there is ongoing work there). For new things, it will be nice to also have tests for them \"somewhere\" :) (preferably in VTS ofcourse)",

But they does not check if bpf syscall configuration is turned on by default. smuckle@ is trying to add some kernel self test to VTS test so the correct kernel configuration can be checked.
