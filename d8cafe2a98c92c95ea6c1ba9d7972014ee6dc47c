      "message": "This check will run during boot on all the testing TH does but there\u0027s no way to verify the configs are as intended. In the patch 1 case the precondition was something that didn\u0027t exist so the requirement would never be enforced.\n\nThe best way to test this IMO would be build a kernel with CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL_ZERO disabled and boot the platform on it with this change, to verify that an error is reported on boot. You should see a \"there\u0027s a problem with this device\" dialog and some adb log spew about an FCM (framework compatibility matrix) error.",
